RapidNewProject
===============

Short and simple stuff to rapidly start a new project for MODX Revolution.

It is currently in development, so while you are free to check it out.. it's.. well.. unfinished! :P

The idea is to have a simple form (maybe at some point CLI-friendly) which allows you to quickly set up the required stuff for a MODX Revolution Extra. Project files in a separate dir, linked back with system settings and namespaces. Allowing you to select what MODX core to use allows quick replication to other versions as well, from the same project code base. I'm also considering skeletons for the project directories if they don't exist yet.
